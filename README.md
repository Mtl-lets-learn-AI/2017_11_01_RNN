# 2017_11_01_RNN
Meetup 2017 11 01 about Recurrent Neural Networks

## Overview

In this session, we'll try to grasp the concept of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We'll use Google's [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library to code a very basic RNN.

## Session

After the common introduction part where we present ourselves a little bit, we'll start by "quickly" going through a nice introductory video [A friendly introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNmqTiOnRfg) by Luis Serrano to have a common sense of what an RNN is all about. After that, the real fun starts and we'll delve into the code and the concepts.

## Dependencies



## Usage

Type `jupyter notebook` into terminal and the code will pop up in your browser.
