# 2017_11_01_RNN
Meetup 2017 11 01 about Recurrent Neural Networks

## Overview

In this session, we'll try to grasp the concept of *Recurrent Neural Network* (RNN). We'll use Google's [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library to code a very basic RNN
from the tuturial [How to build a Recurrent Neural Network in TensorFlow (1/7)](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/hello-world-rnn-83cd7105b767).

## Session

After the common introduction part where we present ourselves a little bit, we'll start by "quickly" going through a nice introductory video [A friendly introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNmqTiOnRfg) by Luis Serrano to have a common sense of what an RNN is all about. After that, the real fun starts and we'll delve into the code and the concepts.

## Dependencies

See code.

## Usage

Type `jupyter notebook` into terminal and the code will pop up in your browser.

More on [notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

## Credits

We basically wrapped the very nice two first tutorials of Erik Hallstr√∂m:

- [How to build a Recurrent Neural Network in TensorFlow (1/7)](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/hello-world-rnn-83cd7105b767)
- [Using the RNN API in TensorFlow (2/7)](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/tensorflow-rnn-api-2bb31821b185)
